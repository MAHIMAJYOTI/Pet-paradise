Built Petâ€™s Paradise, a pet adoption and care platform with a responsive React.js interface and reusable UI components such as pet cards, carousels, and dynamic forms. Designed engaging consumer experiences from scratch with a focus on accessibility, consistency, and seamless navigation. Collaborated with backend developers to integrate APIs and ensure smooth data flow. Emphasized scalable design patterns, modular components, and clean code practices to create a maintainable frontend system. This project strengthened my problem-solving, product-thinking, and business-oriented approach to building user-centric applications.
